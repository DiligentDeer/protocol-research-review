In the short term, due to low liquidity on the bLUSD-LUSD3CRV pool, bLUSD sell pressure from the chicken-in can impact the price of bLUSD in a negative way. 

Chicken bonds try to offset this by providing additional rewards to the LP through the 3% chicken in fees.

One of the variables for bLUSD accrual is the accrual parameter. The mechanism tracks the average bond age and when it goes beyond 15 days the accrual parameter is lowered.

Lowering the accrual parameter would cause the bLUSD accrual to speed up.

Speeding the bLUSD accrual will change the non-profitable chicken in trade to a profitable one. 

When they chicken in, the extra profit (which otherwise would not be generated if alpha was not lowered) will come from the bLUSD market price.

It is likely that the market price of bLUSD drops and trades near the floor price in the long run. 

When the market price trades near the floor price trading activity between bLUSD & LUSD will slow down resulting in an opportunity cost as well as IL for the LPs.

Some more factors that can impact the bLUSD market price negatively if not true.

- Bonding volume is greater than the chicken in volume.
- Users chicken out after bonding for a considerable time.
- Users chicken in early.

When people are not confident in holding ETH in a flash crash there exists a chance that LUSD might get depegged.

Though the historic performance of LUSD has been prolific, it canâ€™t be ignored.

The LUSD ChickenBonds Protocol makes use of B.Protocol to invest funds in the stability pool for generating yield. In an adverse situation, the collateral is liquidated at less than 110% (minus discount) which can cause losses for the stability pool depositors.

The B.Protocol's integration with Liquity was audited in July 2021 and does offer an Immunefi bounty of $100k. https://immunefi.com/bounty/bprotocol/

Moreover, the integration is live on the main net since Aug 2021.

Stacking different protocols for yield generation can increase the risk surface as well. The vault contract is live for more than 5 months and Yearn protocol can be considered as time-tested since Feb 2021.

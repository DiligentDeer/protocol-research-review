# Asset Risk Assessment - lvUSD (Archimedes)

#### (One sentence summary of the report)

### Index

\[WIP]


### Relation to Curve

Archimedes has a [lvUSD/3CRV](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-268/deposit) pool where LPs can provide liquidity in 3CRV to earn ARCH incentives provided by Archimedes through the Curve gauge. As of publishing time, Archimedes has not approached the Curve community for CRV rewards allocation. In this report we investigate the leverage farming strategy employed by Archimedes and risks posed to holders of lvUSD and Curve LPs.

### Product-market fit exploration

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">what problem Archimedes identifies and more completely explain</mark>_&#x20;

Archimedes believes that over 95% of the yield on Curve does not come from transaction volume. Meaning 95% of the value being generated is not due to capital being utilized, yet still, liquidity providers are being rewarded handsomely for their money essentially sitting there. Archimedes wants to utilize this idle liquidity.

> We believe that CRV emissions are capping Curve's ability to scale. And we all want to see a stablecoin Curve pool that supports large investments without materially impacting the pool’s APY. Ideally, this pool provides relatively good yield, generated from real economic activity.
>
> Source: [Archimedes Docs - Motivation](https://docs.archimedesfi.com/tokenomics-and-ecosystem/motivation)

Fluctuating APYs between projects and pools has forced users to switch between pools to get better yields consistently. As network fees continue to increase, the game has become dominated by whales and left the little farmer on the sidelines.

Archimedes want to build a stablecoin pool where they provide yields that resulted from the economic utility (real yields) for the liquidity providers while also unlocking the idle liquidity in the liquidity pools for the leverage takers to farm the best yield strategies.

#### Solution

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">how they consider their platform a solution to those problems (high-level explanation of what Archimedes is- This intro section is where to introduce what Archimedes is)</mark>_

Archimedes has created a meta pool lvUSD/3CRV.&#x20;

Archimedes provides yield to the liquidity providers in ARCH tokens and leverage takers (borrowers) need to pay for the interest (in ARCH tokens) upfront before taking leverage. Since the yield generated by putting up leverage is greater there will be a demand to open a leveraged yield farming position thus a buy pressure on ARCH tokens to pay for leverage. Archimedes justifies the real yield narrative for their yields in ARCH tokens by its utility to buy leverage.

The ARCH yield provided by the protocol is dynamically adjusted such that it remains on the top in terms of yields in a subset of high TVL stable coin pools on Curve finance.

### Archimedes mechanics

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">I want a complete overview of the system design before explaining the LP/LT market participants.</mark>_

Archimedes provides leverage to borrowers and for providing leverage, it relies heavily on the 3CRV liquidity in the lvUSD/3CRV pool to function.&#x20;

To ensure this liquidity, Archimedes aims to consistently provide the best yields through their dynamic emission mechanism. This dynamic emission mechanic takes TVL and yields of other stablecoin pools, and yield dilution of the lvUSD/3CRV pool into consideration.&#x20;

Now, when liquidity is set in place, the leverage taker (borrower) can bid for the leverage using their ARCH token. The ARCH paid for the leverage can be considered as an upfront interest payment to the Archimedes treasury which will eventually flow to LPs.

Leverage takers can only invest funds in predefined strategies decided by Archimedes.&#x20;

#### High-level strategy mechanics

The borrower provides a principal which would act as collateral. This collateral would be in an asset that can be used as an input asset in the predefined strategy (for e.g. Archimedes has an OUSD strategy that uses an OUSD token as collateral).

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/image.png)

After paying for leverage, Archimedes would mint an outsized amount of lvUSD (no. of lvUSD > no. of OUSD).&#x20;

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/leverage.png)

Archimedes aims to provide 9.73x leverage including collateral. So, Archimedes would mint lvUSD 8.73x the amount of collateral provided. This lvUSD is swapped to OUSD via lvUSD/3CRV and OUSD/3CRV pools.

Archimedes holds this position of OUSD to earn yields and provides an NFT to the leverage takers as a receipt of this position. The leverage taker can redeem this position anytime.

### lvUSD

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">ADD SECTION lvUSD as an Asset - Explain how lvUSD comes into circulation (leverage rounds).</mark>_&#x20;

lvUSD: 0x94A18d9FE00bab617fAD8B49b11e9F1f64Db6b36

[lvUSD ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x94a18d9fe00bab617fad8b49b11e9f1f64db6b36)is meant to follow the $1 peg and is paired to 3CRV in [lvUSD/CRV](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-268/deposit) pool.&#x20;

The only utility of lvUSD is the ability to be swapped to 3CRV in lvUSD/3CRV. This utility is only beneficial to Archimedes as they can mint lvUSD to swap for 3CRV to invest in yield strategies on behalf of leverage takers.

#### Leverage Rounds

Archimedes provides a fixed quantity of leverage in rounds and they call these events a leverage round. When the lvUSD pool on Curve has a healthy balance of lvUSD to 3CRV, leverage can be made available to Borrowers (Leverage Takers / LTs) to Open Positions.

The Archimedes Leverage Round auctions have a starting price and an ending price of the leverage provided per ARCH token. This is done through dutch auctions where the amount of leverage per ARCH token starts low and is gradually increased until the end price hits or the available leverage is exhausted.

Details on a leverage round comprise the following things:

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/ttributes.PNG)

Note that Archimedes usually provides leverage with a position lifetime of 370 days.

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">Explain the ARCH token utility within the system for accessing leverage https://twitter.com/ArchimedesFi/status/1636468115184943104?s=20</mark>_

Leverage taker needs ARCH for buying leveraged and they can use the [ARCH/USDC](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x128dd66e4c9f1477ba29523b379aec6ace76d584) pool on Uniswap to buy leverage.

Every time a borrower takes leverage, the lvUSD is minted and swapped for 3CRV. Thus the lvUSD quantity in the lvUSD/3CRV increases, pushing the price lower. The price of lvUSD w.r.t 3CRV matters to the borrowers at the time of repayment of borrowed assets. lvUSD price also matters to liquidity providers as it directly impacts the slippage on their trade while depositing or withdrawing their liquidity in 3CRV.&#x20;

#### Price stability of lvUSD

Archimedes controls the amount and frequency of leverage given to the borrowers. This ensures the price of lvUSD stays near the $1 peg.

* Leverage is capped: Archimedes opens a new auction only when there is enough liquidity in the pool. Each auction is for a limited amount of leverage and is designed to maintain the balance of the pool.&#x20;
* lvUSD >> $1: If lvUSD rises above $1, Archimedes will raise the leverage cap. More lvUSD will be borrowed and enter circulation, returning the lvUSD peg.
* lvUSD << $1: If lvUSD drops below $1, LTs have an arbitrage opportunity by unwinding their position. LTs will pay back $1 worth of debt for less than $1, pocketing the instant arbitrage profits. This process burns lvUSD and increases the amount of 3CRV in the pool.

> Underlying asset losses peg: lvUSD is over collateralized by the underlying assets. In case the underlying asset loses its peg (<< $1), Archimedes automatically closes the LTs’ positions (no penalty to users - this isn’t liquidation, this is closing the position, returning the debt and making the remaining profit available to the LT) . All lvUSD debt is paid back and the borrowed 3CRV returns to the Curve pool.

<mark style="color:red;">Archimedes also talks about the case when an underlying asset (OUSD or any asset under 3CRV) loses its peg. This case is discussed later in the report.</mark>

### Protocol Participant: Liquidity Provider

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">Describe simply how to participate as an LP (deposit in lvUSD pool and earn yield) -</mark>_

As a liquidity provider, a user can simply deposit 3CRV in the lvUSD pool and will receive ARCH incentives on top of swap fees generated on the pool.

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">Describe the ARCH dynamic emissions scheme (without comment on how well it resists manipulation, just explain mechanics in place.)</mark>_&#x20;

Archimedes aims to provide ARCH incentives such that the overall yields are consistent. This is made sure through their dynamic emission mechanism. Here is the schematic on how dynamic emissions works:

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/dynamic%20emissions.png)

Source: [Docs - ARCH Dynamic Emission](https://docs.archimedesfi.com/tokenomics-and-ecosystem/arch-dynamic-emissions)

Basically, they compare other stablecoin pools and adjust their yield accordingly to attract liquidity. This mechanism is designed to make the lvUSD pool among the top stablecoin pools with the best yields.

#### **Mechanics Breakdown**

* Target APY: It is decided based on the data of the top 10 stablecoin pools sorted by TVL. If the lvUSD pool is in the top 5 pools then the target APY is the average of the top 5 stablecoin pools sorted by APY. Else the target APY is 1.2x the average of the top 5 stablecoin pools sorted by APY. The APY and TVL data are fetched from Defillama (_\* “Target APY” is calculated based on the_ [_Defillama_](https://defillama.com/yields?project=convex-finance\&attribute=stablecoins) _data_).
* Target TVL: Now with a target APY, TVL value is also needed to make sure the APY is not diluted when liquidity comes. The target TVL is 1.1x the 7-day moving average of the lvUSD/3CRV pool. This data is fetched from&#x20;
* Benchmark ARCH price: To compute the amount of ARCH to be released as emission, determining the ARCH price is essential. The ARCH price used for computation is a 7-day moving average of ARCH price data from coingecko (\*\* _If ARCH price isn’t available on Coingecko, the algorithm will use ARCH/ETH Uniswap pool data and Coingecko’s ETH/USD (taking the last 7 days average ETH/USD price)_).

[x] _<mark style="color:blue;">I’d like to know if there is manual approval required to update the emissions, so ultimately is trust placed in team or is trust in the price feed aggregation (using coin gecko price sounds very sus, and uniswap TWAP sounds possible to manipulate also if no manual approval required) -</mark>_

Currently, the whole computation of dynamic emission is done manually by the team.

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/manual%20emission.png)

Moreover, there are emission ranges (guardrails) for every quarter to ensure the adequate emission

> For every year, the algorithm sets a minimum and maximum emissions to avoid edge cases, i.e. what we call emission guardrails. Otherwise significant drops in ARCH price or other unexpected event might drive ARCH to overinflate.

#### **ARCH Tokenomics**

Total Fixed Supply: 100,000,000 ARCH.&#x20;

> All 100,000,000 ARCH pre-minted to Archimedes treasury to support dynamic emission schedules and experimenting with the correct way to conduct leverage auctions.&#x20;
>
> Source: [Archimedes Docs - Tokenomics](https://docs.archimedesfi.com/tokenomics-and-ecosystem/tokenomics)

The ARCH token allocation is as follows:

* 50% Community: Liquidity mining incentives
* 30% Team and future team members: one-year cliff with total three linear vesting&#x20;
* 15% Investors and future investors: one-year cliff with total three linear vesting&#x20;
* 5% Foundation/Development program: development cost, audits, service provider, OPEX, and partnerships

#### Incentives for Liquidity providers

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">Explain LPs earn fees from trade fees and use that to move into section on Leverage Takers -(Don’t include risk to liquidity providers here, save it for risk section) https://twitter.com/ArchimedesFi/status/1627408252110774272?s=20</mark>_

Liquidity providers only receive ARCH incentives from Archimedes besides the swap fees provided by Curve.&#x20;

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/discord1.PNG)

ARCH incentives that are distributed to the liquidity providers are vaguely linked to the fees collected by the protocol treasury from the leverage takers.

### Protocol Participant: Leverage Takers

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">reiterate on leverage round, that pool conditions need to be right to open access to leverage and a dutch auction takes place to open a position.</mark>_&#x20;
* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">how is ARCH token involved in the process -</mark>_

For a borrower looking for leverage, they must participate in one of the leverage rounds conducted by Archimedes. The ARCH fee to buy leverage will be deducted from the provided collateral itself.

The amount of leverage available per ARCH token is determined through a dutch auction, which starts with a low price and gradually increases until the desired amount of leverage is reached or there is no more leverage available. This auction is called the Archimedes Leverage Round.&#x20;

#### Fees w.r.t leverage farming

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">Explain fees-leverage fee, origination fee, performance fee LP vs LT: https://twitter.com/ArchimedesFi/status/1633254608020840448?s=20</mark>_

There are 3 types of fees associated with the Archimedes Protocol and will be transferred to the protocol treasury:

* Leverage Fee
* Origination Fee
* Performance Fee

All fees are collected and sent to the Archimedes Treasury to later be used to incentivize and reward the Liquidity Providers (Lenders) of the 3CRV/lvUSD Curve Pool.&#x20;

* Leverage Fee (ARCH Token) - When a user Opens a Position they pay some ARCH tokens as an upfront fee to access the leverage (lvUSD). It is not required for a user to hold ARCH tokens as Archimedes will take the fee from the funds provided as principal.
* Origination Fee (Collateral Asset) - When a user Opens a Position there is a one-time 0.5% origination fee applied. This 0.5% amount is applied to the leverage amount (borrowed amount) and is collected from the collateral asset (OUSD). The origination fee is 0.1% at the time of writing the report.&#x20;
* Performance Fee (Collateral Asset) - The Performance Fee is 30% and it applies only to the Interest Earned from the full position (interest earned from Collateral and Leverage). This fee is deducted from the interest earned and is taken only when the position is closed or when it expires.
* Open & Close Exchange Fees - 1% of the collateral is charged as Open & Close Exchange Fee

These fees can be tracked on the Archimedes [calculator page](https://calculator.archimedesfi.com/?levPrice=0\&originFee=NaN).

#### Yield Strategy (OUSD)

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">-What tokens does it accept as collateral,</mark>_&#x20;
* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">How does the underlying strategy earn returns for leverage takers (yield bearing stabelcoin strategy concept)</mark>_
* [x] <mark style="color:blue;">ADD SECTION OUSD strategy- Explain in detail how the strategy works under the hood. I’ll try to make a flow chart like in previous reports to show contracts and flow of funds</mark>

Archimedes offers leveraged strategies to its users, allowing them to choose from pre-decided options. There is only one strategy right now which is holding the OUSD token.&#x20;

Archimedes offers an opportunity to leverage farm the OUSD yields. Under this OUSD strategy, a borrower must provide collateral in DAI, USDC, or USDT. OUSD is a meta vault token that earns yields through rebasing i.e. the supply of OUSD would increase as the yield is generated from the investment position, thus keeping the price of OUSD near $1.&#x20;

By using this strategy, a user can farm almost 9.73x yield with the funds that are only supposed to yield 1x.

Here is the breakdown of the whole leverage yield investment process:

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/ArchOUSDstrategy_2.png)

* 1: User deposits USDC/USDT/DAI&#x20;
* 2,3: Swap leverage fee amount to ARCH&#x20;
* 4,5: Swap deposit token to OUSD&#x20;
* 6: Pay leverage fee
* 7: OUSD is sent to the Coordinator, which is in charge of the overall flow of creating positions and unwinding positions. It keeps track of funds in the vault, updating CDP as needed and transferring lvUSD inside the system. It is controlled (and called) by the leverage engine.
* 8: OUSD is sent to OUSD Vault, which holds OUSD managed by Archimedes under all positions. It mints shares for deposited OUSD.&#x20;
* 9: Performance fee is taken from the OUSD vault based on all unhandled OUSD rebases in the vault since the last contract interaction. The fee is 30% of interest earned and can be collected once a position has been closed or expires.&#x20;
* 10: Mint OUSD vault share to Coordinator&#x20;
* 11: 8.73x the amount of OUSD collateral in lvUSD is sent from Coordinator to Exchanger&#x20;
* 12,13,14,15: Exchanger swaps lvUSD to OUSD via two respective Curve pools&#x20;
* 16: OUSD received is sent to Coordinator&#x20;
* 17: .1% origination fee is paid.&#x20;
* 18: Amount of OUSD minus fee is sent to the OUSD vault&#x20;
* 19: OUSD vault shares are minted to the Coordinator&#x20;
* 20: Unspent ARCH sent back to the user (The fee estimate is not always exact so ARCH dust is returned to the user)&#x20;
* the 21: Protocol mints NFT to user that represents their position (amount of collateral, amount borrowed, expiry)

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">OUSD Overview- This section can be simplified. Main point I think is OUSD uses several strategies under the hood to generate yield (determined by governance so they change periodically?) and yield is distributed to OUSD holders by accruing directly through rebasing</mark>_
* [ ] _<mark style="color:red;">Risk of OUSD strategy- I’d compare to agEUR which uses underlying stategies and suffered from Euler exploit (protocol paused and agEUR depegged)</mark>_

Origin Dollar (OUSD) was launched in September 2020 on the Ethereum network. Its design is superior to existing stablecoins because OUSD captures competitive yields while being passively held in wallets.

> OUSD is a stable currency that is backed 1:1 by other stablecoins like USDT, USDC and DAI. As a result, 1 OUSD should always be very close to 1 USD in value.
>
> Origin Dollar - [Docs](https://docs.ousd.com/how-it-works)

#### Underlying strategies

OUSD deploys the stablecoins that have been deposited to the OUSD smart contract to other DeFi protocols such as Compound, Aave, and Curve to generate yields. The interest collected, trading fees, and rewards tokens are consolidated and converted to stablecoins to produce OUSD-denominated yields. To ensure that OUSD holders receive the best yield, the protocol moves assets in and out of different liquidity pools over time.

Here is the current allocation of funds for yield generation:

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/ousd%20strategies.png)

Source: [OUSD Analytics](https://analytics.ousd.com/)

The distribution of assets among the supported strategies is determined by veOGV holders through weekly snapshot voting. After the weekly poll, the results are implemented on-chain by the Strategist multi-sig group (known as "Strategists") at their discretion and subject to their review.

If over 50% of the weighted votes are in favor of the current allocation, Strategists may opt not to take any action. However, if the Strategists consider any of the allocations to be unsafe for the funds behind OUSD, they have the authority to withhold their execution.

Strategists do not have the authority to introduce new strategies or withdraw funds without undergoing the timelock process.&#x20;

The returns generated by the protocol are shared with OUSD holders through constant rebasing of the money supply. OUSD adjusts the money supply based on the yield generated by the protocol, enabling the price of OUSD to remain at $1 while the balances in token holders' wallets reflect real-time yields earned by the protocol.

The OUSD strategy by Archimedes uses OUSD/3CRV pool for making redemption of OUSD.

## Past Exploits

On November 7th, 2020, OUSD was exploited for 7M USD due to a previously undetected reentrancy bug. You can read more details about the hack on our blog as well as the detailed compensation plan for taking care of the affected users. Origin Dollar was relaunched in December after completing multiple audits and security upgrades. You can learn more about the steps taken to secure the protocol in our relaunch announcement.

## Risk Vectors - OUSD Strategy

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">OUSD third party platform risk- this is included in OUSD strategy risk, or group risks related to OUSD and the strategy together</mark>_

### **Smart contract risk**

OUSD is [audited ](https://docs.ousd.com/security-and-risks/audits)and also offers a bug bounty of up to $250,000 OUSD. Origin has retained [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) to formally verify the various security properties of our contracts. They helped Origin to establish automated verifications that will run anytime we update our contract code. Origin has automated checking for common errors with [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) and [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) tests.&#x20;

However, it is important to note that even with formal audits, it is still possible for there to be logic errors that could lead to the loss of funds for OUSD holders.&#x20;

### Custody Risk

There is a primary admin contract, a 5 of 8 multisig which is required to make any code changes to the protocol. OUSD can only be upgraded from this 5 of 8 multi-sig wallet. The keys to this multi-sig are held by individuals with close ties to the company, and not even the Origin founders acting together have enough control to execute owner functions on their own. In addition, the OUSD contracts are owned by a timelock which places a 48-hour time delay before any changes to the protocol can be made.&#x20;

Time-delayed admin actions give users a chance to exit OUSD if its admins become malicious, are compromised, or make a change that the users do not like.

Some functionality, such as rebalancing funds between strategies or pausing deposits, can be triggered without the timelock and with far fewer signers. This allows the Origin team to react more quickly to market conditions or security threats. These signers, known as Strategists,  have the ability to execute a limited number of functions __ with only 2 of 9 signers. The strategist multisig can do the following actions on the vault:

* reallocate - move funds between strategies
* setVaultBuffer - adjust the amount of funds held outside strategies for cheaper redeems.
* setAssetDefaultStrategy - which strategy mints and redeems pull from for a particular strategy
* withdrawAllFromStrategy - remove funds from a single strategy and send them to the vault
* withdrawAllFromStrategies - remove funds from all active strategies and send them to the vault
* pauseRebase - pause all rebases
* pauseCapital - pause all mints and redeems
* unpauseCapital - allow all mints and redeems

### The risk associated with Asset depeg

Any reduction in the value of the underlying stablecoins will have a corresponding impact on the value of OUSD. It is worth noting that although OUSD aims to maintain a 1:1 relationship between its supply and the number of supporting stablecoins, there is no guarantee regarding which stablecoins will form this backing, nor their value. Additionally, each supported stablecoin introduces a level of counter-party risk that should not be underestimated.

> OUSD rebasing will only increase supply since the amount of OUSD minted is tied to the realized gains earned by the underlying strategies. Your principal is protected as long as nothing goes wrong with the underlying lending/AMM and stablecoin protocols. Your OUSD balance will never decrease, but the value could drop if there's a failure in the underlying systems.
>
> Source: [OUSD Docs](https://docs.ousd.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply)

**OUSD Third-party platform risk**

OUSD is built on top of other DeFi platforms like Aave, Compound, and Curve which add additional smart contract risk. There are no guarantees that the underlying third-party platforms will continue to work as intended, and any failure in an underlying strategy would potentially lead to a loss of funds for OUSD holders.

## Risk Vectors - Archimedes

### Smart Contract Risk

For Liquidity Providers (lenders), the relevant smart contracts are:

* Curve smart contracts
* Uniswap smart contracts
* OUSD smart contracts
* Archimedes’ smart contracts

The protocol smart contracts are audited by [Halborn Security](https://halborn.com/) to guarantee the quality and security of every change the team makes to its smart contracts. You can view the [Audits here.](https://docs.archimedesfi.com/audit-and-code-bounty/audits)&#x20;

### Depeg Risk

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">Depeg Risk- the section on peg stabilization mechanism should be in lvUSD as an asset section.</mark>_&#x20;
* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">As for risk of depeg, I’d like more info on how and when protocol may force LPs to close borrow position</mark>_

There is no utility of lvUSD for the users and it is only meant to be utilized by Archimedes to facilitate leveraged position for the borrowers. lvUSD can break the peg to the 3CRV in the following situations:

1. Uncapped leverage distribution.
2. Unintended withdrawals of 3CRV by LPs
3. If assets under 3CRV lose their dollar peg.

Since all the decisions regarding the leverage rounds are at the team's discretion, lvUSD depeg due to uncapped leverage distribution relies on how actively the leverage distribution is managed. Yields can ensure there are no unintended withdrawals of 3CRV.&#x20;

If an underlying asset (an asset that backs lvUSD i.e. OUSD or DAI, USDC, USDT) loses its peg Archimedes would lock the user's position till the investments make enough cash to repay the borrowed capital. It is still possible for the leverage taker to close the position but then the collateral would be used to recover the borrowed leverage.&#x20;

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/1233.png)

### Collateral Risk / Underlying Assets Risks

* [x] _<mark style="color:blue;">Underlying assets risk- I want more info on how a OUSD depeg would play out for users</mark>_

If the OUSD peg drops below $1, the value of lvUSD would also go down because currently, OUSD is the only strategy used by Archimedes. In the case of OUSD depeg, leverage takers would be able to withdraw funds without worrying about Archimedes locking their position. This is possible as all the lvUSD is backed by the OUSD strategy and if OUSD and lvUSD depegs to a similar price or lower, the loan repayment would not require any extra funds. The effect of asset depeg will be seen while swapping from OUSD to 3CRV and while swapping from lvUSD to 3CRV. Here both, the liquidity prover, as well as leverage taker, would suffer a loss but as the liquidity provider's funds were used to provide leverage, they will be impacted the most.

It is even possible that lvUSD depegs more than OUSD in the event of OUSD depeg. This is because of the liquidity providers pulling their capital out of the pool on the news of OUSD depeg.&#x20;

&#x20;to a value where Borrowers do not have enough OUSD to pay their leveraged debt, this would typically cause a liquidation of the users’ collateral.&#x20;

In this scenario, Archimedes will instead lock the user's position until there is enough OUSD to pay the debt _(either by OUSD regaining its peg or by the position earning more yield over time)._ The user can still exit by selling their position NFT in an NFT marketplace, such as OpenSea.

### Risk exposure due to economic activities

#### Slippage

LPs should be aware that entering and exiting the liquidity pool with single-sided liquidity would incur slippage. Moreover, the pool proportion at the time of entry and exit would impact the resulting slippage.

Archimedes can control the pool proportion by providing adequate lvUSD leverage. They intend to keep the pool proportion near 50% for lvUSD at the time of computing leverage rounds.

![](https://github.com/DiligentDeer/Assets/blob/main/lvUSD/pool%20limit%20for%20leverage.png)

**Inflation**

* [ ] _<mark style="color:blue;">Inflation- The dynamic emissions scheme is kind of fishy, should also look into that more</mark>_

With dynamic emissions, Archimedes wants the TVL to grow constantly. They are providing emission rewards to the LPs in ARCH tokens for this intended outcome.&#x20;

So far, the leverage available per ARCH token is cheaper than the ARCH emitted to sustain the liquidity in the lvUSD/3CRV pool. In other words, the absorption of ARCH tokens (in the form of leverage fees) is lower than that of the emission provided. This creates inflation in the ARCH price and with more and more spread between the absorption and emission, the price of the ARCH token would drop.&#x20;

There are events that can lead to a subsequent chain of events that would result in a price decline for ARCH tokens.&#x20;

When the availability of leverage is less, the inflation on ARCH price will rise. This is possible when the pool ratio is heavily shifted towards lvUSD. At this time protocol will rely on the borrowers to close their position in order to provide further leverage to new leverage takers.

This again poses a risk to the LP because the gains made by the leverage taker when they close their position to repay the debt at a discount will be suffered by the LP in terms of slippage.

As discussed earlier, inflation is already a catalyst in the chain of these subsequent events.

## LlamaRisk Gauge Criteria

Centralization Factors

1.  Is it possible for a single entity to rug its users?

    Yes, because the protocol controls and owns all the funds invested in the yield strategies.

2.  If the team vanishes, can the project continue?

    No, because there are many mechanisms that are not active yet and the team makes the decision off-chain for many moving parts of the protocol.

Economic Factors

1.  Does the project's viability depend on additional incentives?

    The protocol refrains from using CRV rewards based on their communication in the protocol docs as of writing the report.
2.  If demand falls to 0 tomorrow, can all users be made whole?

    Depends. If the underlying assets (3CRV) are stable and pegged, subsequently if the assets associated with the yield-earning strategies are performing as intended, users can be made whole.

Security Factors

1. Do audits reveal any concerning signs?

\#Risk Team Recommendation (Don't worry about this section in the first draft, we will discuss together and with the protocol team to determine our final recommendation)

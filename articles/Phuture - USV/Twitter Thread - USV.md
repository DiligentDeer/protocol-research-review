Balanced incentives towards borrowers and liquidity providers for their participation at Notional ensure a stable yield for the lenders.

Phuture's saving vault acts as a lender at Notional and it would earn lending yield from the cUSDC at the very least.

At Notional's end, the interest rate oracle is being utilized to prevent someone from manipulating the liquidity pool and taking advantage of the resulting interest rate.

---

Notional uses an unprocessed Chainlink price feed to facilitate liquidations and even if the borrower's collateral is only slightly under the required level, the liquidator can purchase at least 40% of it.

---

Notional has been audited, has an active Bug Bounty ($1,000,000) with immunefi, and is certified by industry leaders including Certora, ABDK, Code Arena & OpenZeppelin.

Notional Finance has an on-chain reserve fund that can be utilized to help cover any losses as the possibility of insolvency in an unexpected event cannot be ignored.

Given the current successful vote in favor of allocating a CRV gauge for USV-FraxBP, it is in the community's interest to monitor the performance of the pool to ensure that it does not attract opportunistic LPs. 

---

In the event that the pool fails to generate adequate volume, it may be prudent to consider discontinuing the CRV reward stream. 

Such a decision would be made in the best interest of maintaining a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.
